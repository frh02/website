I am a graduate student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto. I am working as a Research Assitant at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health in collaboration with Shiphrah Biomedical Inc., as an intern advised by [Mr. Allan Kember](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allankember/) and [Dr. Elham Dolotabadi](https://ihpme.utoronto.ca/faculty/elham-dolatabadi/). I am also working as an intern at JACOBB - Center for applied Artificial Intelligence in the field of Computer Vision and Deep Learning. Previously I had been working at the Multimedia Lab, University of Toronto under the supervision of [Dr. Konstantinos Plataniotis](https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~kostas/) and [Dr.Mahdi Hosseini](https://www.unb.ca/faculty-staff/directory/j-herbert-smith-centre-tme/hosseini-mahdi.html) in the field of Computational Pathology.

My research interests includes design and implementation of AI models especially in the field of Healthcare. Highly engrossed in fields like Deep learning, Computer Vision and Data Science. Mastered the skills like analytical thinking, and problem solving by doing research internships at IIT Palakkad and Indigenous 5G testbed, IIT Madras. My bachelor dissertation strengthened my knowledge on Medical Image processing and Deep learning and also enhanced my skills on team management and scientific writing.

Looking forward to work on interesting projects involving Computer Vision and AI. Feel free to approach me over [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahavi-selv/).
