abstract: Information technology plays a key role in collecting, exchanging, and processing information from the disaster-prone areas like war field and international borders. One such significant role is to monitor the health condition of the soldiers in the war field remotely to ensure their safety. The data transmission in these areas is not reliable over wired connections. This paper focuses on designing a health monitoring system which transmits the data such as health parameters of soldiers like temperature, pulse rate, blood oxygen level and Electro Cardio Gram (ECG) over a Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) with an efficient routing protocol through nRF24L01 to the control room. The efficient protocol is identified by comparing the different MANET protocols simulated using OMNET++. The body parameters are sensed using different bio-sensors attached to soldiers' body and the data is transmitted to the control room through the mobile nodes in the route (i.e., the soldiers' nodes act as mobile nodes to transfer the data). Since the sensed body parameters are transmitted via offline, it ensures secure communication. The proposed system is also provided with an SOS (Signal on ship) facility, to alert the control room during an emergency via cloud service.
